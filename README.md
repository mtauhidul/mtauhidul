# Tauhid here 👋

I enjoy building clean, intuitive, and quietly intelligent web applications.  
I work mostly with JavaScript — and it’s the ecosystem I feel most at home in — using React, Next.js, Firebase, and a bit of backend when needed.

I like solving real problems, exploring new ideas, and creating small tools that make things feel simpler.
